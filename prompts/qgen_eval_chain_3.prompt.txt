Human: You are a teacher grading a quiz.

You are given a question, the context the question is about, and the student's 
answer.

QUESTION: {question}
CONTEXT: {context}
STUDENT ANSWER: {predicted_answer}
TRUE ANSWER: {generated_answer}

You are to score the student's answer as either CORRECT or INCORRECT, based on the 
context.

Write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion 
is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset.

Please provide your response in the following format:

<result>
    <qa_eval>
        <question>the question here</question>
        <student_answer>the student's answer here</student_answer>
        <true_answer>the true answer here</true_answer>
        <explanation>step by step reasoning here</explanation>
        <grade>CORRECT or INCORRECT here</grade>
    </qa_eval>
</result>

Grade the student answers based ONLY on their factual accuracy. Ignore differences in 
punctuation and phrasing between the student answer and true answer. It is OK if the 
student answer contains more information than the true answer, as long as it does not 
contain any conflicting statements.
